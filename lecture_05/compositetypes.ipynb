The main difference is that in Python methods are bound to the class, while Julia defines functions outside of the composite types. This is very important since Julia uses multiple-dispatch. It means that functions consist of methods, and Julia decides which method to use based on the number of input arguments and its types. Since all arguments are used for method selection, it would be inappropriate for functions to \"belong\" to some composite type. As a consequence, we can modify existing methods or add new ones without the necessity to change the composite type definition.
