# ### Exercise:
# 
# Write the function `solve_wave(T, L, wave::Wave; n_t=100, n_x=100)` that solves the wave 
# equation.
# 
# **Hint**: Follow the procedure from the previous exercise. Discretize time and space, 
# initialize the solution, add the boundary conditions, add the initial conditions and 
# finally, iterate over time.
