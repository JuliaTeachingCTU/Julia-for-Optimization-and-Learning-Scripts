Welcome to our course **_Julia for Optimization and Learning_**. This repository provides scripts with all the codes from the lectures. More information, as well as all lectures, can be found on the [official course website](https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning/stable/)


## Usage

The repository must be initialized before it can be used. It can be done by running `initialization.jl` script located in the main folder.

```bash
julia ./initialization.jl
```

Note that the repository depends on a lot of packages and therefore initialization may take a few minutes.

- The repository contains 13 folders, each corresponding to one lecture of the course.
- Each folder contains one or more Julia scripts.
- All scripts must be evaluated from the main folder, i.e. working directory must be set to the main folder.
- Students are supposed to use scripts without `-solved` label and try to solve all exercises by themself.
